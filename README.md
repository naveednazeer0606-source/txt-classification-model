# Week 2 – Natural Language Processing

## TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODEL

**Description:**
Train a Multi-Class Text Classification Model to classify text into four categories: News, Spam, Social, and Sentiment. The model uses TF-IDF for vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier for prediction.

**Challenges Completed:**
* Used TF-IDF for word embeddings and feature extraction.
* Evaluated model performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
* Generated a Confusion Matrix visualization to analyze classification accuracy.

**Tech Stack:**
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run the Project

1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Run the script:
   python spam_classifier.py

3. Output:
   The script will display the Confusion Matrix heatmap first. Close the graph window to proceed to the interactive text classification mode in the terminal.
